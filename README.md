# Amiibo dataFetch
## Description
This is a project that fetches and renders data from an external source with React. The data source is https://amiiboapi.com/. The data is rendered in a list using Bootstrap elements. The list is paginated in groups of 10.
## How to Run
Download files, spin up a local server, open index.html.

## Roadmap of future improvements
The items will be presented in a Card format rather than a list format.
